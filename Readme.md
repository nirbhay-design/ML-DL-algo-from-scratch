This is the repository created to implement the Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms from scratch 

Models implemented

Mlp, K-means clustering , Resnet50 , squeezenet , squilenet (combination of squeezenet and mobilenet)

How to use? 

just install the required dependencies (pytorch , torchvision ) and you are good to go to use the models or take reference from the scratch implementations
